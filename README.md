# Hand/Palm Cropping
![greenLine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afe01a3b-cf2a-4542-bff2-d0dda69196fa)
### I have used openCV and mediapipe libraries to detect the palm and then remove everything else from the image except the palm and store the output image into a file.
### There are two python files. palm cropping and hand cropping.
- palm croping : crops only the palm.
- hand croping : crops the palm with fingers.
